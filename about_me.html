		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<div class="text-content">
			My name is John Georgvich. I'm a twenty year-old student at Clarion University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Information Systems. My minor is in Computer Science, and I hope one day to apply this knowledge in a professional capacity as a software/application developer, a system administrator, or a project manager. <br /><br />

			Before university, I already had a massive interest in computers. I vividly remember using my parents' iMac desktop computer for hours on end as a young child, and that interest carried on throughout elementary school. In middle school, I built my first computer out of an ond HP Office desktop tower. From there, I began to teach myself programming with some success. Prior to attending university, I was well-versed in writing and applying Python and HTML/CSS in personal projects (automating desktop functions, making fan-sites for things I was interested in, etc.)<br /><br />

			At university, I applied a lot of my prior knowledge and inherited a slew of new information, being educated and educating myself in C#, C++, Java, and Javascript. Naturally, I used these "new" technologies in-class for the instructor's purpose; but I continued tinkering at home and trying my best to build things. For the most part, I was generally unsuccessful due to a combination of little free-time (working a full-time and part-time job, full credits each semester, and a personal life) and lack of motivation.<br /><br />

			Outside the realm of computing, my hobbies include skating (for which I've built two skateboards custom), music (playing, producing, and collecting), and the drawn/painted arts (although, don't ask me to paint for you).<br /><br />
