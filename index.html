			My name is John Georgvich; and unless I sent it to you, you've probably reached this page in error.<br />
			That's fine, though. I'll explain what this site is going to be used for.<br />
			Here is where I'll be posting my notable coursework, papers, projects, and homegrown ideas. <br />
			Additionally, I'll be hosting my resume and CV here eventually (once I get them done).<br /><br />
			In the meantime, it'll just serve as an empty, desolate reminder of how poor my web development skills are.
